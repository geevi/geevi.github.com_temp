    After a 4 months, i am coming back home due to a viral fever. I got a much needed rest at home. During 3 months of my summer vacation i have been totally engrossed in my internship, working even on weekends. Things didn't go better even on college, with lots of seminars to come up with and the project.

Though the rest was much needed, i rather felt totally bored at home. I was trying to gather interest in something, but failing all the time. Watching tv seemed totally absurd. All Malayalam channels have programs not worth watching, and i had seen most of the English films almost 3 times by now. Then i thought of doing some programming. After all i plan to have a great career in that field. I should get interested in something there. Then i tried to work on my project. That also hit dead ends. Each day i started waking up saying, oh another boring day of my life.

But the real reason for getting bored, i guess was a different thing. I am awaiting the results for the interviews for a job at the place were i did my internship. They were taking a long time to decide. Recently they called me asking for some certificates. Getting it for some reason, would be considered a legendary in my college. I was at the height of anxiety. I was starting to get fed up by this. I check my mails every now and then, keep staring at my new mobile for a call from Hyderabad. I tried to avoid the anxiety by being pessimistic. I tried to assume that i wont get the job. That way i will either be surprised or nothing happens. But it kept coming back.

I got recovered. Onam holidays also happened to be nearby or rather, i took a medical certificate for the previous week keeping that also in mind. We also got an new car on an exchange offer. There also happened to be some price reductions due to onam. Achan selected  the "champane biege" color( a some what dull yellow orange color, the color of sandal wood). He says the blues and the reds had too much show, and he wanted something that looked humble. Me and my brother didn't make any opinions.

We had our first trip to achans family house. I thought that would cheer me up. It brought memories of good old days. On all vacations all my cousins on my fathers side would gather there. It was a wonderfull place, with lots of big and small streams. We used to own a small long boat. On afternoons we would get on it and go for small rides in our land. It consisted of mainly swamps separated by long stretches of land in between. There were coconut trees, banana plants and mango trees also.

Steering the boat using long bamboo sticks, enjoying the shade and also some comic books which we took along. We would search for coconuts that have fallen down, or check whether there is a ripe banana bunches. In the early stages there will be a cone shaped koombu for banana, from which you can take its flowers. Inside the petals, there will be a sweet liquid, honey like thing. We used to enjoy having it.

Now those days had gone. Most of my cousins, girls married and off to far away places, and boys doing some jobs. Me too will be busy doing some work after an year. I am back home. Today night i will be leaving back to college. That would keep me occupied with classes and seminars. I hope that would solve my boredom.
