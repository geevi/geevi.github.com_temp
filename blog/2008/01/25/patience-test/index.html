    I am back to blogging after a long time. I really have some thing to write now. Its about a patience test that i had to endure.

I had planned to do my project work on making a simple OS from the L4 Microkernel. The idea behind microkernels is exactly the basic idea of cs, abstraction, modularity. In traditional OS's the different abstractions(like filesystems, virtual memory, drivers etc) is made into a bundle called the kernel. When you write code for each of those, one need to be careful about how it affects a lot of other things. Moreover since there a large amt of code, more bugs are there. Independent development is also not possible. Microkernel idea involves making the os fully modular. The kernel includes only the bare minimum code. FS, VM etc are implemented as userlevel servers. But there is a catch. They are usually slower. But now intel and amd are chips having 2-4 cores, 3Ghz etc. So microkernel has a lot of significance in coming days. The project was to implement an FS, VM and drivers as userlevel servers on top of L4 Microkernel. It is acutally done as a course project in University of Dresden Germany. So i googled a lot, read something here and there, downloaded the code and all. But there was one small trouble, i was not able to compile it. I worked hard on it, but nothing seemed to be going well. I lost patience and then went and asked my guide whether i could change to a theoretical topic.

He was lenient. He gave me one. It was on Cryptography. The title was "Psuedorandom functions using NP-Hard problems". Psueodorandom functions as the name implies are used to generate random nos. Generating random number is itself a sort of contradiction(random number by definition is random).  Actually thats a question in Complexity theory of which answer is  still unknown whether BPP = P.

Well i had to learn about One-Way functions, Hardcore Predicates. There was one theorem, that there is a particular hardcore predicate for any one-way function. Its been nearly 2 months i been reading the proof. I never understood it completely. Many a time i discovered that what i had taken for granted previously was not trivial. I was not ready to loose my patience again. Quite unexpectedly i was just reading through the proof again, and today i uncovered the mystery.
