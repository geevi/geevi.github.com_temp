    <span style="font-size:180%;">The Abstract:</span>
I am writing this with regard to the recent hikes in fuels and inflation. The government is being highly criticized by the left and the bjp on this account for gaining political mileage. Their criticisms are unscientific and mostly on value judgments. However this is a dangerous trend that we should counter which otherwise will seriously affect our countries future.

<span style="font-size:180%;">The Facts:</span>
International oil prices increased to 130$ a barrel. The private oil companies are taking huge losses on current prices. If the trend continues their shares go down. In an year they will be completely closed down.

Today the petroleum minister announced the price hike on petrol correct to 2 decimal places. He explained how much the companies needs for recovery and exact figures of how much he expects from duty cuts, some bonds and some they loose and the rest from the hike. The finance minister reluctantly agreed to cut the duties. He counts on every paise of that he gets from duties on fuel for his massive farm and medical allowances in the budget.

The cpm spokesperson said "Dont give us figures. The government has no right to put burden on the common man. The private companies are making profit while they allow common man to suffer."

The BJP copied some of what they said and made up something similar of their own.

<span style="font-size:180%;">The Inferences:</span>
1. The opposition doesn't believe in figures.(Note: Though they come up with some figures, and some economist proves them to be wrong, then they goes back to their value judgement. I just saw a few interviews on tv where this happened. Which leads to 1. itself)

2. Only thing that is politically correct for cpm and bjp is no burden on common man even if the private companies run at loose.

<span style="font-size:180%;">The Wider Implications:</span>
On 1.) : Any educated person know that our intuitive judgments are mostly wrong. Each options the gov has will have to be quantitatively evaluated and the best should be chose. Disregarding this is the disregard to any scientific approach, it is disregarding reason.  This trend has also gone to other fields. On the nuclear deal, the same parties are disregarding the opinion of scientists like Dr APJ Abdul Kalaam.

On 2.) : The reason for price hike is not caused by private companies. They also belong to people who are Indian citizens(in fact the most productive) and government has every right to protect them. The duty of the government is not to steal from the rich and help the poor. It is against any sort of justice. A crisis is a crisis and everyone will be affected on some way. Imagine a community which punishes its most productive members.  Thats what followers of 2.) are suggesting. If this is promoted, it will lead to massive "brain drains".

<span style="font-size:180%;">The Conclusion:</span>
As i mentioned above, opposition is disregarding science and promoting social injustice. This is a dangerous for our country. Whats more dangerous most people agree with them. Even some of the educated ones. It seems from the media that even the congress leaders are reluctant to talk about this to the people fearing it will affect their popularity. At this juncture its time for everyone who understands this to give support the the PM and promote awareness of these dangerous implications.
